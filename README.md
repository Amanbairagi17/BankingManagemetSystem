#Banking Management System â€“ Project Description

The Banking Management System is a simple yet functional console-based Java application that allows users to manage basic banking operations through a MySQL database. It simulates essential features of a real-world banking system such as user registration, login, account creation, and basic transactions.

#Key Features:

User Registration: New users can register by providing personal details, which are stored securely in the database.
Login System: Registered users can log in using their credentials.
Account Creation: After successful login, users can create a new bank account associated with their profile.
Transactions: Users can perform basic transactions like deposit and withdrawal, and the system updates the account balance accordingly.
Data Persistence: All user and transaction data is stored and managed using MySQL.


#Technologies Used:
Java (Core Java, JDBC)
MySQL (For database management)
IDE: IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse



#Objective:
This project aims to demonstrate core Java programming skills, JDBC for database interaction, and the basic logic behind banking applications. It provides hands-on experience in CRUD operations, database connectivity, and user management.
